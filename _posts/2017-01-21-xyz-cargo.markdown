<blockquote>
    "The ambition that powers the development of XYZ CARGOs and XYZ SPACEFRAME VEHICLES exceeds the mere ambition of building bikes and trikes: We want to change the way we move things and persons, the way we produce things, the way we share and distribute things, the way we live. We want to contribute to creating a better and more fair world."
  </blockquote>


  


The XYZ CARGO system is based on the Open Source XYZ SPACEFRAMES VEHICLES developed by Copenhagen-based N55, an innovative design collective which is "a platform for people to work together, share places to live, economy, and means of production".
