Here are the introductory words to [a useful info graphic](35-body-language-secrets-that-will-help-you-get-ahead-at-work) for anyone who wants to improve their visual communication cues. 



  

<blockquote>
    "It will walk you through situations where your visual signals are especially important, and the key ways to adjust your mannerisms for success. Trying to win that new client? Mirror his or her behavior. Want to disagree without making enemies? Smile and nod frequently."
  </blockquote>


  


The long and short of it? Be open, sincere and receptive.
