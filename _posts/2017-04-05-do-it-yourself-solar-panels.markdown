Wikihow is a great resource for interesting weekend projects for the hobbyist.  Here is an [article that gives details of how to build your own solar panels](http://www.wikihow.com/Build-a-Solar-Panel) from solar cells which can be bought online.  You will also need non-conductive boards, tabbing and bus wire, soldering equipment, plywood, paint, diodes, a charge controller and batteries.




This article is particularly intriguing in light of the rapidly falling cost of solar cells.  Are we moving towards a time when we can be energy-independent?  Imagine a [farm settlement](https://muyiwagbadegesin.com/blog/2017/3/23/the-tomorrow-farm-life-more-abundant-for-nigerias-youth) that builds and maintains its own solar power arrays!
