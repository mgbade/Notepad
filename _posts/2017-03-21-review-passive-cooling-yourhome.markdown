Are you designing or building a house soon? If you live in a hot, humid, tropical climate, you seriously need to incorporate passive cooling design principles.




This [resource](http://www.yourhome.gov.au/passive-design/passive-cooling) from the Australian Government will help you in doing this. 




Here's an example of the numerous design guidelines from the article: 




<blockquote>

> 
> Design responses consider shading, air movement, insulation and construction methods.

Shading






  * Permanently shade all walls and windows to exclude solar access and rain.


  * Consider shading the whole building with a fly roof.


  * Shade outdoor areas around the house with plantings and shade structures to lower the ground temperature and thence the temperature of incoming air.
