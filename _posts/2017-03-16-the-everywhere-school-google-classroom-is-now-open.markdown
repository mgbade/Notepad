Following up on my reference to [pervasive learning](https://edu.google.com/products/productivity-tools/classroom/) in my recent post on [reforming education in Nigeria](https://muyiwagbadegesin.com/blog/2017/5/8/thoughts-on-education-reform-in-nigeria-time-to-stop-the-drift), I am pleased to report that Google has just opened up their [Google Classroom](https://edu.google.com/products/productivity-tools/classroom/) product to users without G Suite for Education accounts.




According to the release on their blog: 




<blockquote>

> 
> Now, teachers and students in many different environments can teach or attend classes, manage assignments and instantly collaborate—all with their personal Google accounts.
> 
> 
</blockquote>




Google Classroom is particularly well-suited to actualizing the concept of pervasive learning. The introductory video from the original product launch hints at this direction:

Check out this [extensive list of features and capabalities of Google Classroom](https://support.google.com/edu/classroom/answer/6376881?hl=en).




Of course, Google Classroom becomes even more powerful when combined with other Google for Education products like Chromebooks and Tablets, Docs & Gmail, Google Drive, Vault, Calendar, Forms, Sites, Hangouts, Expeditions and Google Cloud Platform. 




Google Classroom is a product that the Nigerian Education sector should immediately adopt. It's free, easy to use and available everywhere.
