Have you ever wanted to learn more about artificial intelligence and deep learning? This article, '[Learning when to skim and when to read](https://metamind.io/research/learning-when-to-skim-and-when-to-read)', from Salesforce's Metamind blog should be a great resource for you. It's a deep dive into the field of artificial intelligence but written in a clear and accessible style. 




The author, [Alexander Rosenberg Johansen](https://github.com/alrojo), a deep learning researcher at Salesforce, discusses advanced techniques of sentiment analysis that should be of interest to entrepreneurs in the fast growing social media era where monitoring online commentary about your products of services is a top priority.




Johansen's article is set against the background of the pivoting of the AI community problems like [Image Recognition](https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/30/why-image-recognition-is-about-to-transform-business/) to newer frontiers like [Natural Language Processing](https://blog.monkeylearn.com/the-definitive-guide-to-natural-language-processing/)- and how researchers are developing simpler algorithms to address resource heavy tasks.
