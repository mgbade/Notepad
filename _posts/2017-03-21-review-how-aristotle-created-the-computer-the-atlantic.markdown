This [article](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/03/aristotle-computer/518697/) from _The Atlantic_ is a fascinating account of how Aristotle's study of logic, presented in his six-part book _The Organon_, inspired Euclid's _Elements_ and ultimately George Boole's _Laws of Thought_




From Boole: 




<blockquote>

> 
> The design of the following treatise is to investigate the fundamental laws of those operations of the mind by which reasoning is performed; to give expression to them in the symbolical language of a Calculus, and upon this foundation to establish the science of Logic ... and, finally, to collect ... some probable intimations concerning the nature and constitution of the human mind.

This is essential reading for anyone who wants to understand the philosophical and mathematical foundations of modern computing.
