Have you ever taken a personality test? Whether you have or have not, I strongly urge you to take this one. I found it to be eerily accurate at measuring and describing my personality, what drives me, my strengths and weaknesses.




Personality testing has a long and checkered dating from the ancient greeks theory of the four [temperaments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_temperaments) (sanguine, choleric, melancholic and phlegmatic), to [Carl Jung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung)'s theory of Cognitive Functions to Katherine Cook Briggs [Myers-Briggs Type Indicator](http://www.myersbriggs.org/my-mbti-personality-type/mbti-basics/) (MBTI).




The MBTI format presents four possible pairs of personality traits described by four letter acronyms:






  * Introversion (I) or Extraversion (E)


  * Intuition (N) or Sensing (S)


  * Thinking (T) or Feeling (F)


  * Judging (J) or Perceiving (P)




16personalities theory is based on a modification of the Myers-Briggs theory: they use Myers-Briggs four letter acronyms format but have updated the Myers-Briggs and Jungian models to incorporate modern theories, particularly the [Big Five Personality types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits):Mind, Energy, Nature, Tactics and Identity. 




The 16 personality types identified at 16personalities.com are grouped into 4 roles: Analysts, Diplomats, Sentinels and Explorers.




But enough of theory: take the test right now. I would be interested to read your reactions.
