It seems [the National Directorate on Employment (NDE) is finally awake](http://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/227846-nigerian-govt-commence-registration-o%E2%80%8Ef-unemployed-citizens.html). 
Hear this:


  

<blockquote>
    "A statement released, Monday, by the Deputy Director, Information and Public Relations of the National Directorate of Employment, NDE, Edmund Onwuliri, said the registration was aimed at collecting up-to-date data of unemployed Nigerians.  
Mr. Onwuliri said the registration was in compliance with NDEâ€™s mandate to obtain and maintain a data bank on unemployment and vacancies in the country.  
The deputy director, according to the statement, said the exercise would enable the directorate to serve as a clearing house linking job seekers with existing vacancies in government agencies and the private sector."
  </blockquote>


  


Why would they be doing this when it seems their primary responsibility has already been taken over by the Office of the Vice-President through its various social intervention programmes? 

We need to think twice about whether we actually need this agency.
