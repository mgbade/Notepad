**Paper**: [Effect of System Factors on Whistleblowing Attitude of Nigerian Banks Employees: A Conceptual Perspective - Covenant University Repository](http://eprints.covenantuniversity.edu.ng/6674/#.WNInGOt4WK1)




Whistleblowing has become a central topic of discussion with the recent publication of the Federal Government's [whistleblowing policy](https://whistle.finance.gov.ng/_catalogs/masterpage/MOFWhistle/assets/FMF%20WHISTLEBLOWING%20FREQUENTLY%20ASKED%20QUESTIONS.pdf).




A research article published last year by sociologists at Covenant University has identified the need for Nigerian institutions to encourage whistleblowing among their staff as a deterrence to unethical practices. 




Here is the abstract




<blockquote>

> 
> Whistleblowing provides a self-correcting mechanism for an organization to prevent unethical practices.
Lessons from collapsed businesses around the world show that
organisations do not just collapse, but rather it is a gradual
process resulting from a series of inappropriate acts left unaddressed.
This paper is based on a conceptual perspective. Past
studies on whistleblowing were reviewed, gaps and weaknesses
identified to develop a conceptual framework on whistleblowing
reporting attitude of bank employees in Nigeria. The conceptual
framework is anchored on the Resource Dependence (RD) and
Planned Behaviour (PB) theories. The paper provides important
lessons for promoting ethical practices in organisations and the
society at large. Based on the gaps in literature, this paper
recommends among others a performance review system that is
tied to rewarding whistleblowing; ways to protect whistleblowers
and the need to strengthen organizational support
structures for whistleblowing.

Many organisations in Nigeria already have whistle-blowing policies in place. For example, First Bank of Nigeria [has a whistleblowing policy which is available online](https://www.firstbanknigeria.com/themes/fbn/revamp/Whistle%20Blowing%20Policy.pdf).  I'm sure that many Nigrian organisation are in the process of developing whistle-blowing policies.  Scholarly works such as this would be a valuable resource.
