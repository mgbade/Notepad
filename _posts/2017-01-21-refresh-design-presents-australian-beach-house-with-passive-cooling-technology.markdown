<blockquote>the scheme incorporates sustainable design principles, and has been planned to take advantage of natural ventilation, passive solar design and a very economical use of space. building materials such as plantation timber, bamboo for flooring, and plywood for ceilings were used throughout.</blockquote>

This cantilevered beach house by the Australian firm [Refresh*Design](http://www.refreshdesign.com.au/) is an excellent example of context-appropriate architecture.

Materials like corrugated metal, bamboo (flooring), timber and fiber cement sheeting have been combined into a passive solar design that takes advantage of natural ventilation.

The design principles applied here are suitable for tropical and subtropical structures.
