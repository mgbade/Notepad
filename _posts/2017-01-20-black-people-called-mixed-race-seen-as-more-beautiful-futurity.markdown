<blockquote>Just the suggestion that an African-American person is of mixed-race heritage makes that person more attractive to others, research shows.  </blockquote>

<blockquote>This holds true even if the people in question arenâ€™t actually of multiracial heritage, according to a new study published in the journal [Review of Black Political Economy](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12114-015-9218-1).</blockquote>

This study hints at the deep-seated bias associated with identity in the black community. The study presents the results of inteviews conducted on 3,200 black by interviewers of different races who were then asked to rank the black people for attractiveness on a scale of 1 to 5 (with 5 being the most attractive). The interviewees who self-identified as mixed race were consistently ranked as being more attractive. The study was conducted by Robert L Reece of the Department of Sociology at Duke University
