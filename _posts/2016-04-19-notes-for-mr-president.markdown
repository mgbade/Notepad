  1. Address the nation.
  2. Aknowledge the pain and hardship people are going through.
  3. Stress that the pain will be temporary.
  4. List the steps you have taken in the budget (Jobs Programme, Meal a Day, Social Security).
  5. Ask the people to also make sacrifices:
    * Be more productive.
    * Blow the whistle on corruption and waste.
    * Cultivate a saving culture- less consumption.
    * Invest in the future.
  6. Wash, rinse and repeat: institute a monthly 'Talk with Baba' with Nigerians where you talk to them and they get to call in and ask questions. Your primary strength is the power of the 'bully pulpit'. When you speak, everyone listens.

This easily overlooked power is more than sufficient to change Nigeria.
