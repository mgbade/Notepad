Its easy to despair when you consider the lack of quality reading and instructional material for schools in the developing world.  Its already a struggle to increase the enrollment rate. But once you do get kids into school, how do you get enough books, uniforms and qualified teachers?

Thats why the Library For All project deserves our support.

<blockquote>Library For All is a nonprofit with a mission to make knowledge accessible to all, equally.  To achieve this mission, we have built a cloud-based library platform, filled with locally relevant e-books curated for different regions in the developing world.  Library For All is more cost-effective and sustainable than building physical libraries.</blockquote>
