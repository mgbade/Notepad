I remember the early days of the internet when you could spend hours navigating the nascent web looking for the occasional new website that might pop up. 




There were so few websites back then- even the most inane ones easily captured our attention. This was long before the days of social media. 




If you are bored already with Facebook and Twitter, this post on Johnny Lists offers [a great collection of 100 **useful** websites.](http://johnnylists.com/100-incredibly-useful-websites/)




My favourites (in no particular order) are: 






  * [bettermoneyhabits.com](http://bettermoneyhabits.com) – Manage your money better by learning personal finance.




  * [signature-maker.net](http://signature-maker.net) – A free email signature creation tool.




  * [ineedaresu.me](http://ineedaresu.me) – Make your resume suck less.




  * [namechk.com](http://namechk.com) – Check to see if your brand name is available as a .com and on various social networks.




  * [videos.pexels.com](http://videos.pexels.com)- Completely free stock video.




  * [about.me](http://about.me) – The easiest way to make a personal page.
