There's a comment at the end of [this article about whether the protesters were rented ot not](http://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/227847-breaking-huge-protest-national-assembly-ndumes-suspension-senate.html): 

A PREMIUM TIMES’ correspondent at the scene said the protesters did not immediately appear like the usual “rented crowd”. 


  

<blockquote>
    "Many of the protesters said they were natives of southern Borno, Mr. Ndume’s district, but mostly live in Mararaba and Masaka areas of Abuja."
  </blockquote>


  


It's usually not hard to determine this- just hang around until after the protest and see whether they start sharing money. How do you know when they're sharing money? Look out for the dust clouds, curses and howls of pain as they descend into fisticuffs.
