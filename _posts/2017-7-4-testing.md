Like most people, I have a wide range of interests. I love to read, study and think. I am In constant search of that perfect storm of varied thoughts and ideas which I can surf to my hearts content. This has been made possible in our world today where the internet has brought hundreds of terabytes of information within our reach.

Well, life is short and the pace of modern life will not allow us to process all the information at hand. We must learn to organize our time to be able to gain maximum benefits from this explosion of information. In my case, I've tried to organize my interests into a broad categorization which of course is constantly evolving.

These interests will form the framework for things I plan to share and discuss on this timeline. I look forward to useful discussions with you, my dear friends.
